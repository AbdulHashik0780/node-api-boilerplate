# Node API boiletplate

It's a boilerplate for Node web APIs.

## Features

<dl>
  <dt>Multilayer folder structure</dt>
  <dd>
    Code organization inspired by <a href="http://dddcommunity.org/">DDD</a> and <a href="https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">Clean Architecture</a>
  </dd>

  <dt>Instant feedback</dt>
  <dd>
    <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon">Automatic server reloading</a> after a file change when on development mode, makes the development faster and easier.
  </dd>

  <dt>Ready for production</dt>
  <dd>
    Setup with a process manager ready to go live on production. If you use Heroku there's also a Procfile and a post-build task to run the migrations on production.
  </dd>

  <dt>Database integration</dt>
  <dd>
    An <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize">ORM</a> for SQL databases is already integrated, you just have to setup the authentication configurations.
  </dd>

  <dt>Prepared for testing</dt>
  <dd>
    The test suite is prepared to run unit, integration and functional tests.There are helpers to make it easy to do requests to the web app during the tests and clean the database after each test. A <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/factory-girl">factory</a> for the ORM is also setup to make your tests DRY, and the tests generate <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/istanbul">code coverage measurement</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt>Dependency injection</dt>
  <dd>
    With a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/awilix">practical container</a> the code will not be coupled with the dependency injection library and it'll still be easy to resolve automatically the dependencies on the runtime and mock them during the tests.
  </dd>

  <dt>CLI integration</dt>
  <dd>
    Both the application and the ORM have command-line tools to make it easy to work with them. Check the <i>scripts</i> section to know more about this feature.
  </dd>

  <dt>Logging</dt>
  <dd>
    The <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/log4js">logger</a> is highly pluggable, being able to append the messages to a file during the development and send them to a logging service when on production. Even the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan">requests</a> and queries will be logged.
  </dd>

  <dt>Linter</dt>
  <dd>
    A pluggable <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint">linter</a> is setup to make it easy to ensure a code styling and find code smells.
  </dd>

## Quick start

_Notice that the boilerplate comes with a small application for user management already, you can delete it after you understand how the boilerplate works but please do the quick start first!_ ðŸ˜Š

1. Clone the repository with `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/talyssonoc/node-api-boilerplate`
2. Setup the database on `config/database.js` (there's an example file there to be used with PostgreSQL ðŸ˜‰)
3. Intall the dependencies with `yarn` (click here if you [don't have Yarn installed](https://yarnpkg.com/docs/install))
4. Create a the development and test databases you have setup on `config/database.js`
5. Run the migrations with `npm run sequelize db:migrate`
6. Run the application in development mode with `npm run dev` and you're ready to go!

## Scripts

This boilerplate comes with a collection of npm scripts to make your life easier, you'll run them with `npm run <script name>`:

- `dev`: Open the application in development mode
- `start` Open the application ready to production (prefer not to do that in development) 
- `test`: Run the test suite
- `coverage`: Run the test suite and generate code coverage, the output will be on `coverage` folder
- `lint`: Run the linter
- `sequelize`: Alias to use the [Sequelize CLI](https://github.com/sequelize/cli)
- `console`: Open a pre-built console, you can access the DI container through the `container` variable once it's open, the console is promise-friendly
